Description: The package is designed to find lead isotope endmembers from a given set of data points. It implements a two-stage model, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and the geochron slope method to define the endmembers. This approach helps to model the isotopic mixing processes.
